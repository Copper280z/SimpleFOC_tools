/*
 * This file defines a Model class to represent a state space model. Model has three template parameters:
 *
 * X := the number of states
 * U := the number of control inputs (inputs to the model, outputs from the controller)
 * Y := the number of outputs (sensor measurements of the system which are fed back to the controller)
 *
 * You can define any state space model by declaring a Model<X,U,Y> and filling out the system matrics, A, B, C & D
 * appropriately. I've also added a couple of subclasses of Model to represent model that are commonly used in state
 * space control, those being DC motor control for servos and Cart Pole for inverted pendulum problems. I'm planning on
 * expanding on this list but in the meantime feel free to PR if you come up with one of your own that might be widely
 * useful!

 * This model describes the classic inverted pendulum control problem. In this system, a stick mounted on the top of a
 * cart via passive revolute joint. The task is to keep this upright by by accelerating the cart backwards and forwards.
 * The actual modeling for this came from
 * http://ctms.engin.umich.edu/CTMS/index.php?example=InvertedPendulum&section=SystemModeling which defines the state
 * as:
 *
 * x := [cart_position, cart_velocity, stick_angle, stick_angular_rate]^T
 *
 * And it is assumed that 1: a force is directly applied to the cart and 2: that the system is equipped with sensors
 * that can directly measure the cart's displacement and its stick angle.
 *
 * To parameterise the system the following physical measurements are required:
 *
 * M := mass of the cart                       (kg)
 * m := mass of the pendulum                   (kg)
 * b := coefficient of friction for cart       (N/m/s)
 * l := length to pendulum center of mass      (m)
 * I := mass moment of inertia of the pendulum (kg.m^2)
